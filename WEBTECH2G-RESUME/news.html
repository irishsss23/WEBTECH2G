		<p>WHAT IS HTML5?<br>
<br>HTML5 is the latest version of Hypertext Markup Language, the code that describes web pages. It's actually three kinds of code: HTML, which provides the structure; Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which take care of presentation; and JavaScript, which makes things happen.<br>

<br>WHEN WILL HTML5 BE FINISHED?<br>
<br>HTML5 is an evolving standard, so it's a bit misleading to talk about when it'll be finished.<br>

<br>DO I NEED HTML5 BROWSER?<br>
<br>You've probably got one already. All of the big name browsers - Internet Explorer, Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera, Mobile Safari and Android's browser - support HTML5, but they don't all support the same things.
